# üö≤ **Analyzing the Intersection of Citi Bike Usage, Traffic Congestion, and Poverty in NYC**

## Streamline App
According to the instructions, we have created the app prototype in Streamline using data only from Queens, as a preview (to avoid overloading the system). Please enter here:

### **Methodological note for the user:** we have chosen not to establish scatterplots or heatmaps yet (despite having the data, as will be seen on the second page) due to discrepancies in neighborhood names (and geolocation) between official datasets. Therefore, both datasets are presented separately to avoid any confusion or assumptions about this relationship. This will be discussed and modified for later sections of the app; for now, it is just a preview, following the suggested guidelines.

## üìå **Project Overview**
This project investigates how **Citi Bike usage** varies across **NYC neighborhoods** with different levels of **poverty and traffic congestion**. It aims to identify patterns in **bike-sharing adoption, trip durations, and station placements** in relation to **socioeconomic factors** and **traffic conditions**.

## üéØ **Research Questions**
- How does Citi Bike usage exhibit different patterns across NYC neighborhoods with varying levels of **poverty and traffic congestion**?
- What type of **relationship** (positive, negative, or none) exists between **poverty levels, traffic congestion, and Citi Bike trip duration**?
- Do neighborhoods with **high levels of poverty and traffic congestion** experience **lower Citi Bike adoption rates**?
- How do **similar traffic congestion patterns** across different **income brackets** affect Citi Bike trip patterns?
- Are Citi Bike stations **strategically located** in areas with **higher levels of poverty and congestion**, providing an **alternative mode of transportation**?
- **Bike usage and traffic speed patterns** within the day.
- Are bikes primarily used where **people live or where they work**?
- Which stations have the **least and most bikes available**? Are there any stations with **consistently low availability**?
- Did the **adoption of congestion pricing** affect **Citi Bike usage and traffic speeds**?

## üìä **Datasets Used**
The project integrates multiple datasets:

1. **Citi Bike Monthly Trip Data**:  
   - Contains details about bike trips, including **start and end times, station locations, trip durations, and user types**.  
   - **Source:** [Citi Bike Trip Data](https://s3.amazonaws.com/tripdata/index.html)  

2. **NYC DOT Traffic Speeds NBE Dataset**:  
   - Provides **real-time and historical traffic speed data** for road segments across NYC.  
   - **Source:** [DOT Traffic Speeds NBE](https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Transportation/DOT-Traffic-Speeds-NBE/i4gi-tjb9/about_data)  

3. **NYC Department of City Planning‚Äôs Districts and Boundaries**:  
   - Defines **community district boundaries, boroughs, and other geographic divisions**.  
   - **Source:** [NYC Planning Open Data](https://www.nyc.gov/site/planning/data-maps/open-data/districts-download-metadata.page)  

4. **NYCgov Poverty Measure Data (2018) (Under Evaluation)**:  
   - While initially considered, this dataset **lacks location-based references beyond the borough level**.  
   - We may use **American Community Survey (ACS) or NYU Furman Center data** for a **more precise poverty measure**.



## üìå **Setup & Usage Instructions**

### ** 1. Clone the Repository**
To get started, clone the repository to your local machine:

git clone https://github.com/advanced-computing/citibike_project.git
cd citibike_project

### 2. **Create and Activate a Virtual Environment**
To ensure dependencies are managed properly, create and activate a **virtual environment**.

#### ‚úÖ **For macOS & Linux:**
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate

#### ‚úÖ **For Windows (Command Prompt):**
python -m venv .venv
.venv\Scripts\activate

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ **Install Dependencies**
After activating your virtual environment, install the required dependencies from requirements.txt:
pip install -r requirements.txt

**Note: The setup section will be continuously updated over time.**
